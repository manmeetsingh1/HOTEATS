## HOTEATS
_**HOTEATS**_ takes in a search query of any city in the world, and displays the top restaurants in that respective city. The restaurant data is retrieved through the [LOCU API](https://dev.locu.com/). Along with this API, tools used in creating this include HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python's [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. The site is up and running as a [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) app [here](http://hoteats.herokuapp.com/). Below is an example of HOTEATS in action.
